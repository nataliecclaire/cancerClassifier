Hello! Welcome to the cancer classifier. This model aims to aid in the diagnosis process for cancer patients.

Using the genetic expression of 801 patients, I have developed this data into a k-nearest neighbors model that determines a given patient's cancer type based on their gene expression. This is a part of a project completed for my linear algebra and probability course (MATH2015), and comes with a paper that analyzes the process of making this model.

I found the data on UC Irvine's ML Repository. Feel free to take a look as I go through the ML cycle and perfect this model's performace. Here's the link to the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/401/gene+expression+cancer+rna+seq.

To run the model:
1. Click on the file labeled "lin_alg_cancer_classifier.ipynb"
2. Click the "Download raw file" button in the top right of the notebook.
3. Go to Google Colab or Kaggle and upload the file to a new notebook.
4. Download the dataset I used from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Respository either using the link above - note that the dataset is about 200 MB, and may take up a lot of space.
5. Upload the file to your new notebook on Google Colab/Kaggle. You can upload the dataset on Google Colab by clicking on the file button to the left or on Kaggle using the input tab at the top.
6. Run all the cells and watch the model work! Follow along with my descriptions to get a feel for how/why I'm doing each step.

Thanks for stopping by - have a great day! :)
